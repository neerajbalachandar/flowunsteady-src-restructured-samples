# FLOWUnsteady-src-restructured-examples
The flowunsteady rVPM model source codes, explained and re written for special cases of 
flapping wings and rotor-rotor interactions.

The repo currently consists of a well-defined modular code for dragonfly mid-fidelity simulation. 
The simulation took around 4 hours for running 1500 steps in a 12-core CPU intel-i5 64bit.
